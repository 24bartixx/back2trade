# Project description ðŸš€
Back2Trade is a gamified stock backtesting application that simulates trading on historical market data, candle by candle.
For each game session, an account balance is specified along with the desired time interval and candle length. Trades can then be placed in long or short positions with varying margins, and results are summarized at the end of the session.
